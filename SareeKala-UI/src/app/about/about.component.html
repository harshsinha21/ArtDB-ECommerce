      <p class="small mb-0 indented-paragraph">India's history is a tapestry woven with centuries of tradition, culture, and craftsmanship. From the grand courts of ancient empires to the vibrant festivals of today, its legacy is reflected in everything from architecture to attire. Among the most iconic symbols of Indian heritage is the saree — a garment that has graced generations with its timeless elegance.</p>
      <p class="small mb-0 indented-paragraph">Each saree carries the soul of the artisans who create it, blending intricate weaving techniques passed down through families for centuries. Whether it’s the delicate handwoven silk of Banaras, the vibrant block prints of Rajasthan, or the fine embroidery of Bengal, every piece tells a story.</p> 
      <p class="small mb-0 indented-paragraph">At SareeKala, we celebrate this craftsmanship by transforming tradition into art.</p>
